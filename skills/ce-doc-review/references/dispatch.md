# Dispatching the reviewers

Dispatch generic subagents with **bounded parallelism** using the OMP `task` tool where available; otherwise run the work inline or serially. Omit the `mode` parameter so the user's configured permission settings apply.

Respect the harness's active-subagent limit: dispatch only as many selected reviewers as it accepts and queue the remainder. Treat active-agent/thread/concurrency-limit dispatch errors as backpressure, not reviewer failure. Keep rejected reviewers queued while active work or a supported release can recover capacity, and retry when a slot frees. When capacity cannot recover, use the incomplete-stop condition in Phase 2 rather than retrying indefinitely. Record a reviewer as failed only after a successful dispatch times out or fails, or when dispatch fails for a non-capacity reason that survives correcting the invocation.

**Agent lifecycle.** Collect terminal outcomes, including failures, before cleanup. Close or release review-owned agents when the harness provides caller-owned cleanup, before refilling slots, advancing stages, or returning. Do not message completed agents with no remaining work. Do not infer released capacity from completion or interruption, or invent cleanup operations.

For each selected reviewer, read `references/personas/<reviewer-name>.md` and pass its full content as `{persona_file}`. Do not dispatch standalone agents by type/name and do not rely on platform-level custom-agent registration.

**Model tiering lives here, not in prompt assets.** Local prompt files have no frontmatter and carry no model metadata. Apply these dispatch-time preferences when the platform exposes a known model override; otherwise omit the override and inherit the parent model rather than guessing a platform-specific model name:

- `coherence-reviewer`: cheapest capable extraction tier; on OMP, dispatch a `scout` agent.
- `security-lens-reviewer`, `feasibility-reviewer`, `product-lens-reviewer`, `adversarial-document-reviewer`: inherit the parent model; on OMP, dispatch a `reviewer` agent.
- `design-lens-reviewer`, `scope-guardian-reviewer`, `audience-reader`: platform mid-tier model; on OMP, dispatch a `task` agent.

Each subagent except `audience-reader` receives the prompt built from the subagent template included below, with these variables filled:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{persona_file}` | Full content of the selected local prompt asset from `references/personas/` |
| `{schema}` | Content of the findings schema included below |
| `{document_type}` | "requirements", "plan", "unified-requirements", or "unified-plan" from Phase 1 classification |
| `{document_path}` | Path to the document |
| `{origin_path}` | Upstream Product Contract provenance extracted once during Phase 1: prefer the document's `origin:` frontmatter field when present; otherwise `product_contract_source:<value>` when present; otherwise `none`. Personas that adapt on provenance (product-lens, adversarial, scope-guardian) read this slot to gate technique suppression — they do NOT re-parse frontmatter themselves. |
| `{settled_ktds}` | Session-settled decisions extracted once during Phase 1: any Key Technical Decision **or Product Contract Key Decision** entries carrying a `session-settled:` annotation, listed as decision name, class (`user-directed` / `user-approved`), and rejected alternative; or the literal `none`. Personas read this slot — they do NOT re-parse the document for it. |
| `{document_content}` | Reviewer-specific slice. **Legacy** requirements/plan documents: pass the full document, never split. **Unified** artifacts can be large, so a section slice is the default rather than the full artifact — metadata, Goal Capsule, plus Product Contract for product-lens/adversarial/scope reviewers, and additionally Planning Contract and active Implementation Units/Verification/DoD for feasibility/coherence reviewers when `artifact_readiness: implementation-ready`. Escalate to a broader slice only when a reviewer needs cross-section traceability the initial slice cannot assess. `audience-reader` always receives the full document, never a specialist slice. |
| `{decision_primer}` | Round 1: the block below. Round 2+: read `references/decision-primer.md` and render per that file. |

On round 1 — no prior decisions in this interactive session — set `{decision_primer}` to:

```
<prior-decisions>
Round 1 — no prior decisions.
</prior-decisions>
```

**Audience-reader payload.** `audience-reader` is a fresh reader, not a specialist with session context. When dispatching it, do not use the full `<review-context>` slots. Build the prompt from the template's `<persona>` and `<output-contract>` blocks only (schema, confidence anchors, and reconcile rules stay shared). Replace `<review-context>` with the document and the intended audience/task, and omit `<context-slots-rules>` and `<decision-primer-rules>`. Do not fill `{origin_path}`, `{settled_ktds}`, `{decision_primer}`, `{document_type}`, or an expected interpretation — not even as `none`. Pass the full `{document_content}` and `{audience_task}`: the intended audience and the task they must perform, taken from the document's own audience or next-consumer language, or the default next consumer of this document shape. Prior-round review decisions stay out of this payload; synthesis still applies R29.

**Error handling:** if a subagent fails or times out, proceed with the findings from those that completed and name the failed reviewer in the Coverage section. Never block the whole review on one reviewer failure.
